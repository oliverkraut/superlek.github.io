                    <p class="superlekstory">
                        Superlek Kiatmoo9 was born on November 6th 1995 as Manachai Yiamsiri. He was originally from
                        Buriram, in the North-eastern Isaan region of Thailand, well-known for producing many of the
                        best Muay Thai fighters. He began fighting at the age of 7, having been inspired by his two
                        uncles who are also famous fighters. One of whom is the multiple time champion and YOKKAO fight
                        team member, Singdam Kiatmoo9. The fighting talent certainly runs genetically in the family DNA.
                        Following the footsteps of his uncles, Superlek started his Muay Thai training at the famous
                        Kiatmoo9 gym of Buriram.
